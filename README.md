# odin_landing_page

My final Odin project before I start learning JavaScript:)

- I gave up after doing the quotes-section. I've made som annoying CSS mistakes with flexbox during this project. But I know how to tackle this issue in the future.

For example. The image-placeholder box will snap past the flex box grid on the right.
And my information-wheel is oddly enough overlapping my flex-box-grid.
But again. I know how to fix it, but it's a structural issue that I don't want to refactor at the moment.

I will come back to this project again with another angle on how to do this - structurally. So it won't bite my ass later:)
